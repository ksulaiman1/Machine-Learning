    "# Decision Trees and Tree Based Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are a general class of machine learning models that are used for both classification and regression. They have even been adapted for the use of outlier detection. The trained models resemble a tree, complete with branches and nodes. The model is essentially a series of questions with yes or no answers, where the resulting tree structure contains all the combination of responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree based models are popular because they mimic human decision making process, work well for a large class of problems, naturally handle multiclassification, and handle a mix of categorical and numerical data. They are also easy to understand and explain. The transparency of a model is often called its *explicability*. Models with low explicability are often referred to as \"black boxes\" and are difficult to derive insight over the process they are modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will discuss the decision tree model and understand how they are trained and used to make predictions. Further, we will analyze several advanced machine learning models that use decision trees as a building block to create models with greater predictive power."

    "The best way to understand a decision tree is to construct one and visualize it. We'll train a decision tree classifier on the iris data set and visualize the tree with the `Graphviz` package. The iris data set is a famous data set of 150 observations of three different iris species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each observation has measurements of the petal length and width and sepal length and width, for a total of four features."

    "Where does the name gradient come from in gradient boosting trees? Adding a model is analogous to a single iteration in gradient descent. Gradient descent is a minimization algorithm that updates/improves the current answer by taking a step in the direction of the negative of the gradient of the function that is being minimized. The pseudo-residuals represent the direction of greatest reduction in prediction error. Since $h_m$ is trained on the direction of greatest descent of the loss, it will be an approximation of the improvement required for our model to fit the data more closely. $\\gamma_m$ is the step size we should take in the direction of greatest model improvement. Compare the equation above for an improved model with the equation of gradient descent applied to a function $C(\\beta_i)$;\n",

You can think of earlier decisions as working on higher level attributes while decisions deeper in the tree work to distinguish smaller scale features. The described metrics are combined with the decrease in error metric from a split to derived a normalized feature importance score. For ensemble models, the feature importance is averaged across all trees.\n",
